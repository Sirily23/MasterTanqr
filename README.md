# Unified Tanzania QR Payment System(UniTanqr)

Welcome to a project to simplify payments in Tanzania! This repository outlines a unified QR code and Lipa Number system (e.g., "TN123456789") based on the merchantâ€™s TIN, integrating M-Pesa, Tigo Pesa, and Airtel Money using TANQR and TIPS.

## Vision
Replace fragmented Lipa Numbers with one QR code and identifier, managed by a neutral acquirer, to streamline transactions and boost financial inclusion.

## Key Features
- Single QR code with TIN as Merchant ID.
- Unified Lipa Number ("TN" + TIN).
- Interoperable via TIPS, neutral acquirer model.
