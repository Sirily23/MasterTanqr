# Advantages and Challenges of the Unified QR Payment System
This paper identifies the **advantages** and **disadvantages** of implementing a single QR code payment system in Tanzania. The system consolidates various mobile money operators (e.g., M-Pesa, Mixx by Yas, Airtel Money) into one QR code and Lipa Number (e.g., "TN123456789"), linked to a merchant's Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The system utilizes the TANQR standard and Tanzania Instant Payment System (TIPS) to streamline payments and realize interoperability.

- Enabling cross-provider payments (e.g., M-Pesa to Mixx by Yas) adds complexity.

### 6. Cost of Development
- Building the acquirer’s system, including the dashboard and TIPS integration, involves **significant investment**.
- Ongoing maintenance adds to costs.

### 7. Security Risks
